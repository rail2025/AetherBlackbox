This project is a combined and modified work based on the following AGPL-licensed projects:

  - Repository: https://github.com/Kouzukii/ffxiv-deathrecap
  - Used for parsing Dalamud combat logs and extracting the 30-second pre-death event timeline.

- **Drawing App**
  - Repository: https://github.com/rail2025/AetherDraw
  - Used as the basis for the ImGui-based interactive replay and visualization UI.

This repository contains modifications and additional functionality, including
replacing tabular output with a scrubbable replay window rendered via ImGui.
